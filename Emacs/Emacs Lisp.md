# Emacs Lisp

- `C-M-k`: Kill s-expression (works with quotes)

## Comments

Lisp has hierarchical comments (e.g., `;` vs `;;` are indented differently). To insert a specific level of comment, use: `M-2 M-;` where `2` is the number of semicolons to use.

## Movement By S-Expression

- `C-M-f`: Forward by s-expression
- `C-M-b`: Backward by s-expression
- `C-M-d`: Move down in s-expression
- `C-M-f`: Move up in s-expression
