# Tag Style Guide

- Use the singular, except when talking about a concept, e.g., `tools` for the idea of tools, vs. `tool` for a tool.
- For Bookmarks, don't double up the URL information, for example, it it is a link to "Reddit", don't add a `reddit` tag, "Reddit" will already appear in a search.
- Be broad instead of specific, `HTML` rather than `HTML5`.

## Considering

- Proper Punctuation
- Use all lower-case?
- Avoid full names, e.g., "Dave Thomas"
