# Tag Style Guidelines

- Proper Punctuation
- All lower-case?
- Never use plural
	- Except if we are explicitly talking about a concept, e.g., “tools” for the idea of tools, vs. “tool” for a tool
- For Bookmarks, don’t double up the URL information, for example, it it is a link to “reddit”, don’t add a reddit tag, reddit will already appear in a regular search which is more predictable
- Shy away from full names, e.g., “Dave Thomas”, you can use search for that
- Focus on the broad rather than the specific, “HTML” rather than “HTML5”
- A common idiom is two tags, what this is “style.guide” and what’s this about “tag”
