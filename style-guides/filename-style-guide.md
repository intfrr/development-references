# Filename Style Guide

In general, use lowercase, hyphenated filenames (e.g., `filename-style-guide.md`). Only use uppercase filenames with spaces for permanent directories (e.g., `~/Documents`). This helps separate content from structure.

Always disregard the above and use language specific conventions where appropriate, e.g., Cocoa projects use camel case without spaces.
