## Bitwise Operators

- `&`: AND, used to mask off some set of bits, e.g., `n & 0177` masks off all but the lower-order 7 bits of `n` because `0177` (which is in octal) is 127 in base-10, which is seven ones in the lower-order bits in binary.
- `|`: OR
- `^`: Exclusive OR
- `<<`: Left shift
- `>>`: Right shift
- `~`: One's complement (unary)
