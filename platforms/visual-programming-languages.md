# Visual Programming Languages

Advantages of visual programming languages:

- UI can be inline with code
- Live output, i.e., there usually isn't a build and run cycle, the program is just always running
- There aren't syntax and compile errors

Disadvantages:

- Doesn't scale well to complex applications, see the Deutsch Limit.
