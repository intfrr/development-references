# Visual Programming Languages

Advantages:

- UI can be inline with code.
- Live output and faster feedback. There usually isn't a build and run cycle, the program is just always running.
- There aren't syntax and compile errors.

Disadvantages:

- Doesn't scale well to complex applications, see the Deutsch Limit.
